# AUDIO SETTINGS

Alsa = Advanced Linux Sound Architecture

Terminal sound GUI
>alsamixer

install pulse audio daemon
>sudo apt install pulseaudio

Advanced sound settings
>pavucontrol

Loopback audio from microphone to speakers
>pactl load-module module-loopback latency_msec=1

Stop loopback
>pactl unload-module module-loopback

### Noise cancellation
backup config file
>sudo cp /etc/pulse/default.pa /etc/pulse/default.pa.backup

modify config file
>sudo vi /etc/pulse/default.pa

by adding following lines:

>load-module module-echo-cancel source_name=noechosource sink_name=noechosink
>
>set-default-source noechosource
>
>set-default-sink noechosink

Last two lines will also get noise cancellation on your output device, and sometimes your audio wonâ€™t work and you will not hear sound. You will have to manually switch to output device which has no noise cancellation enabled. This is just a heads up, it is up to you to choose. I removed these two lines in my working environment.

restart pulseaudio daemon or restart PC
>sudo pulseaudio -k

In settings set input device the one with noise cancellation

## Config files
Files that are executed on user login
- **~/.profile** - for things that are not specifically related to Bash, like environment variables PATH and friends, and should be available anytime

- **~/.bashrc** - for the configuring the interactive Bash usage, like Bash aliases, setting your favorite editor, setting the Bash prompt

- **~/.bash_profile** - for making sure that both the things in .profile and .bashrc are loaded for login shells.

- **/etc/profile** - for all users logging in to the bash, ksh, or sh shells. This is usually where the PATH variable, user limits, and other settings are defined for users. This file is only run for login shell and therefore does not run when a script is executed.
- **/etc/sudoers** - to config this file always use command *visudo*. This file contains configuration for *sudo* users including their own *PATH* variable which is used during usage of *sudo* command instead of their own.

# SSH MANAGEMENT

## Client:
User specific ssh data should be stored in `~/.ssh directory`

Connect to host as with your username.
>ssh host

Connect to host as user
>ssh user@host

Connect to host using port
>ssh -p port user@host

Open tunnel for application display
>ssh -X user@host

Generate new RSA key pair
>ssh-keygen

Copy local file to home folder on server via SSH using key:
>scp -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub  file_to_copy  USER@SERVER:~/remote_file_path

Copy remote file to local via SSH using key:
>scp -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub  USER@SERVER:~/remote_file_to_copy  local_file_path

SSH config file record structure
```
Host name1
    ...

Host my-ssh-host
    HostName 10.0.0.5
    Port 22
    User myuser
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_myuser #file with private key
        IdentitiesOnly yes   #ssh won't try all keys, just mentioned ones
    ProxyJump name1, name2 #chaining proxies
```
Save public key on SSH server
>ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@host

## Server:
SSH config file: `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`


Installation of openssh-server (might fail - in that case try 'apt remove openssh-client')
>apt install openssh-server

Disable password login
>in config file add/modify line `PasswordAuthentication no` and then restart

Disable root login
>in config file add/modify line `PermitRootLogin no` then restart

Restart ssh server
>systemctl restart sshd

SSH public keys usable for login to specific user are in file: `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

## SSH tunneling
This will open tunnel from local port 9000 to remote port 25 of mail.server.com
> ssh -L 9000:remoteserver.com:25 

Tunnel from localhost to host1 (connection from host1 to host2 is not secured)
>ssh -L 9999:host2:1234 -N host1

This will open a tunnel from localhost to host1 and another tunnel from host1 to host2. However the port 9999 to host2:1234 can be used by anyone on host1. This may or may not be a problem.
>ssh -L 9999:localhost:9999 host1

>ssh -L 9999:localhost:1234 -N host2


This will open a tunnel from localhost to host1 through which the SSH service on host2 can be used. Then a second tunnel is opened from localhost to host2 through the first tunnel.
>ssh -L 9998:host2:22 -N host1

>ssh -L 9999:localhost:1234 -N -p 9998 localhost


If host 1 has service available for locahost, take it and provide it on your locahost.
```
# provide it on localhost of your machine only
ssh -L 127.0.0.1:<local-port>:127.0.0.1:<remote-app-port> -N login@host1

# or provide it on all interfaces
ssh -L 0.0.0.0:<local-port>:127.0.0.1:<remote-app-port> -N login@host1
```

## SSH proxy
Dynamic or multi-port forwarding

List used ports:
>sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN

Create SOCKS5 socket on localhost:9876
>ssh -D 9876 remoteServer

Wherever any request comes to localhost:9876, it is forwarded to remoteServer which asks on behalf of original user

```
chromium --proxy-server="socks5://127.0.0.1:9876"
```

For example create dynamic tunel with previous command.
In brower go to network configuration a set SOCKS proxy server to LOCALHOST:9876
Now every request will got through remoteServer first.
