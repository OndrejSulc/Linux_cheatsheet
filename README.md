# Linux cheatsheet

This repository contains my Linux commands cheatsheet. In cases where I need to analyze or design stuff at level of operating system it helps me to remind all posibilites.

There are
- [markdown](src/Linux%20cheatsheet.md) version for quick online searching and
- [pdf](src/Linux%20cheatsheet.pdf) version for download and print.

- [Docker + Docker Compose](src/docker.md)
